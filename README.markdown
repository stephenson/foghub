Foghub associates Git commits with Fogbugz cases and code reviews.

The code is under development.

Why do code reviews?
====================

[Simply read this blogpost](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/01/code-reviews-just-do-it.html).

Feature plans
=============

Associate commit with case: 

    git commit -am "This is a commit #65"

This will post a comment to case 65 on Fogbugz with the commitmassage and a link to the commit on Github.

Ask for codereview:

    git commit -am "This is a commit that needs review #review @user"

This will add a new case in Fogbugz in the category "code review" and assign it to the user.

Ask for codereview and associate with case:

    git commit -am "This commit to case #65 needs #review by @user"

This will add a new case in Fogbugz in the category "code review" and assign it to the user but will also post a comment to case 65 in Fogbugz with the commitmassage and a link to the commit on Github.

And commits can be associatet with more then one case:

    git commit -am "This commit is closing case #65 and #66"

This will post a comment to both case 65 and 66 on Fogbugz with the commitmassage and a link to the commit on Github.
  
If you commit whitout ref to a user it will automaticly make a new case, but it dosent asign it.
